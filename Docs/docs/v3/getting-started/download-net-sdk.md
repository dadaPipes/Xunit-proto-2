# Download the .NET SDK

The .NET SDK is available for download for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Once youâ€™ve downloaded and installed the SDK, open a fresh command prompt of your choice (CMD, PowerShell, bash, etc.) and make sure that you can access the command line by typing `dotnet --version`. You should be rewarded with a single line, describing the version of the .NET SDK you have installed:

```shell
$ dotnet --version
8.0.404
```

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you run the dotnet command, it may perform some post-installation steps. Once these one-time actions are done, it will execute your command.
