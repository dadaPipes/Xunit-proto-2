# Write your first theory

You may have wondered why your first unit tests use an attribute named [Fact] rather than one with a more traditional name like Test. xUnit.net includes support for two different major types of unit tests: facts and theories. When describing the difference between facts and theories, we like to say:

- Facts are tests which are always true. They test invariant conditions.

- Theories are tests which are only true for a particular set of data.

A good example of this is testing numeric algorithms. Let’s say you want to test an algorithm which determines whether a number is odd or not. If you’re writing the positive-side tests (odd numbers), then feeding even numbers into the test would cause it fail, and not because the test or algorithm is wrong.

Let’s add a theory to our existing facts (including a bit of bad data, so we can see it fail):

```csharp
[Theory]
[InlineData(3)]
[InlineData(5)]
[InlineData(6)]
public void MyFirstTheory(int value)
{
    Assert.True(IsOdd(value));
}

bool IsOdd(int value)
{
    return value % 2 == 1;
}
```

This time when we run our tests, we see a second failure, for our theory that was given 6:

```shell
$ dotnet run

=== TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY ===
   MyFirstUnitTests  Total: 5, Errors: 0, Failed: 2, Skipped: 0, Not Run: 0, Time: 0.085s
```

Although we’ve only written 3 test methods, the test runner actually ran 5 tests; that’s because each theory with its data set is a separate test. Note also that the runner tells you exactly which set of data failed, because it includes the parameter values in the name of the test.
